# aware-shopping

[IN PROGRESS]<br />

This is my first big Java web app. It's a base of products produced in Poland or by Polish producers abroad, so the social
awareness could be increased. It allows user to create an account, add producer and product, edit or delete them, leave a review on product. There is also an admin that has extra options. The back end is written in Java using Spring and Hibernate frameworks, with usage of JavaScript, Ajax and JSON. In frontend I used Bootstrap 3, HTML and CSS. <br />
